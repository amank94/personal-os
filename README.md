# PersonalOS

A task management system designed for AI assistants with intelligent deduplication and MCP server integration.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/amanaiproduct/personal-os.git
cd personal-os
```

### 2. Run Setup (5 minutes)
```bash
setup.sh
```

The setup will:
- Create your workspace directories
- Guide you through a work-life balance interview
- Generate your personalized GOALS.md
- Copy template files

**Note:** Python 3.10+ is only needed if you want to run the MCP server. The basic setup works with just bash.

### 3. Start Using It
```
# In your AI assistant (Claude Code, etc.)
"Read CLAUDE.md and help me get organized"
```

## 📝 Essential Commands

**Daily Use:**
- `"Process my backlog"` - Turn notes into organized tasks
- `"Show me my P0 tasks"` - See urgent items
- `"What should I work on?"` - Get AI suggestions
- `"Mark [task] as done"` - Complete tasks

**Weekly Maintenance:**
- `"Show system status"` - See your workload
- `"Clean up old tasks"` - Archive completed work

**When Stuck:**
- `"What's blocking me?"` - See blocked tasks
- `"Show active tasks"` - See work in progress

## 🎯 How Priorities Work

- **P0**: Do today (max 3 recommended)
- **P1**: This week (max 7 recommended)
- **P2**: Scheduled (default)
- **P3**: Someday/maybe

The system warns you if you have too many urgent tasks.

## 🔄 Daily Workflow

### Morning (2 minutes)
1. `"Show me today's priorities"`
2. Pick 1-3 tasks to make active
3. `"Start working on [task name]"`

### During Work
- Brain dump into `BACKLOG.md` whenever ideas pop up (no structure needed)
- Update task notes as you go
- `"Block [task] - waiting on [reason]"` if stuck
- Save supporting documents to `Knowledge/`

### End of Day (2 minutes)
1. `"Mark [task] as done"` for completed work
2. `"Show me tomorrow's tasks"` to prep

### Weekly (5 minutes)
1. `"Process my backlog"` - Turn notes into structured tasks
2. `"Clean up old tasks"` - Archive completed work
3. Review and adjust priorities
4. Update `GOALS.md` if priorities shifted

## 📊 Task Status Codes

- `n` = Not started
- `s` = Started (actively working)
- `b` = Blocked (waiting on something)
- `d` = Done (auto-deleted after 30 days)
- `r` = Recurring (weekly review items)

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Brain dump freely** - Use BACKLOG.md for quick capture, process later
2. **Link knowledge** - Save important docs to Knowledge/ and reference them in tasks
3. **Be realistic** - 3 hours of deep work = 1-2 big tasks max
4. **Context is king** - Tasks should explain WHY they matter, not just WHAT to do
5. **The system gets smarter** - It learns your patterns over time
