## Requirements

- **Python 3.10 or later** (required for MCP SDK)
- pip package manager

## Quick Start

### First-Time Setup (5 minutes)

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url> personal-os
   cd personal-os
   ```

2. **Create virtual environment and install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   python3.11 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the interactive setup**:
   ```bash
   python setup.py
   ```
   
   The setup will:
   - Create necessary directories (Tasks/, Knowledge/, Resources/)
   - Use LLM-powered conversation (or manual interview) to understand your goals
   - Generate a personalized GOALS.md based on your responses
   - Copy template files (CLAUDE.md, config.yaml, .gitignore)
   - Create your BACKLOG.md for quick notes
   
   **Take your time with the interview questions** - your answers help the AI agent understand what matters to you and make smarter priority decisions.

4. **Start using your Personal OS**:
   ```bash
   # In your AI assistant (Claude, etc.)
   "Read CLAUDE.md and help me get organized"
   
   # Or start the MCP server (advanced)
   python core/mcp/server.py
   ```

## How Should You Use This?

### Initial Setup (First Time)
1. **Run `python setup.py`** - Take 5-10 minutes to thoughtfully answer the onboarding interview
   - Questions about your vision, current role, and objectives
   - What success looks like in 12 months and 5 years
   - Your top priorities and what you're building toward
   - The AI uses these answers to create a personalized `GOALS.md` that guides all task prioritization

### Daily Workflow
2. **Brain dump into `BACKLOG.md`** - Whenever ideas pop up, throw them in here
   - No structure needed - just raw notes and thoughts
   - Save supporting documents to `Knowledge/` or `Resources/`
   
3. **Process your backlog** - Weekly or when it gets full:
   - Say to your AI: "process my backlog"
   - AI will detect duplicates, ask for clarification on vague items
   - Creates structured tasks in `Tasks/` with proper categories and priorities
   - References your `GOALS.md` to assign priority levels
   
4. **Get AI guidance throughout the day**:
   - "What should I work on today?" - AI suggests tasks based on priority and time of day
   - "Show me my P0 tasks" - See urgent items
   - "Help me with [task name]" - AI expands task with detailed action plan
   - "What's blocking me?" - See blocked tasks

5. **Keep status updated** - Mark tasks as you work:
   - `n` = not started
   - `s` = started (actively working)
   - `b` = blocked (waiting on something)
   - `d` = done (will auto-delete after 30 days)
   - `r` = recurring (weekly review items)

### Weekly/Monthly Maintenance
6. **Review and realign**:
   - **Weekly**: Review your P0/P1 tasks, update `GOALS.md` if priorities shifted
   - **Monthly**: Deep review of goals, prune old tasks, adjust strategy
   - The AI will proactively remind you and suggest what needs attention

## What's What

### Core System (`core/`)
- **Public and reusable** - Safe to commit and share
- Generic MCP server with deduplication logic
- Template files for configuration
- No personal information

### Personal Data (root level)
- **Private** - Should be gitignored
- Your actual tasks, goals, and notes
- Your customized configuration
- Never committed to public repos

### Examples (`examples/`)
- Sample workflows and use cases
- Demo tasks and configurations
- Learning resources

## Features

- 🎯 **LLM-Powered Setup** - Claude conversation generates personalized GOALS.md (or manual fallback)
- 🧠 **AI-Powered Prioritization** - Uses your goals to intelligently assign task priorities
- 🔍 **Smart Deduplication** - Automatically detects duplicate tasks before creation
- 🤔 **Ambiguity Detection** - Flags vague items and asks clarifying questions
- 📊 **Intelligent Task Organization** - Auto-categorizes with context-aware priorities
- ✍️ **Anti-Slop Writing Guidelines** - Built-in guardrails for natural, non-AI-sounding content
- 🔧 **MCP Server** - Professional tool interface for AI assistants
- ⚙️ **Fully Customizable** - Adapt the system to your workflow
- 📝 **PM-Optimized** - Categories and workflows designed for product managers

## For Contributors

The `core/` directory contains the reusable system. Contributions should:
- Not include personal information
- Be generic and configurable
- Include documentation
- Follow the existing patterns

## For Personal Use

Your personal files stay in the root directory and are gitignored:
- `Tasks/` - Individual task files with metadata and context
- `Knowledge/` - Reference documents and notes
- `Resources/` - Context materials (articles, transcripts) for AI to understand your perspective
- `BACKLOG.md` - Unstructured notes inbox
- `GOALS.md` - Your personalized goals (generated from LLM conversation)
- `CLAUDE.md` - Your AI agent instructions
- `config.yaml` - Your configuration
