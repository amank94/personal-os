# PM Demo Backlog

## PM's Brain Dump - End of Week

Deep research: analyze how Slack, Linear, and Asana handle API rate limiting and developer experience - need comprehensive report for our API v2 strategy
Draft launch announcement copy for new AI assistant feature - needs blog post, email campaign, and in-app messaging copy by next week
Customer interview with Spotify team about API integration needs - super important!!
Write release notes for v2.3.4 before Thursday deploy
DAU dropped 5% last week - need to investigate why
Review PRD for new onboarding flow with design team
Sprint planning for next week - need to groom backlog first
Follow up on A/B test results from growth team about checkout flow
CEO just slacked about strategic pivot - need to assess roadmap impact
Customer complained on Twitter about mobile app crashes
Notion just shipped something similar to our Q2 roadmap item - need competitive analysis
Post-mortem for last week's incident still needs to be written

When you run "Process my backlog", the system will:
1. Prioritize research and content generation tasks
2. Detect urgent items like Thursday deploy and customer issues
3. Create subtasks for complex items
4. Auto-categorize (technical, outreach, research, writing, admin)
5. Suggest priorities based on deadlines and strategic impact
