# Backlog Example

This shows what a typical BACKLOG.md might look like before processing:

---

Call John about the partnership proposal
need to review those API docs from last week
Fix the login bug that Sarah reported - urgent!
prepare for board meeting next Tuesday
  - financial review
  - product roadmap update  
  - hiring plan
Research competitors pricing models
Reach out to that investor I met at the conference - Tom something from Sequoia?
Write blog post about our new feature launch
Update LinkedIn profile
Book flights for NYC trip
Follow up with customers from the webinar
Plan team offsite
look into why the dashboard is slow
Send thank you note to conference organizers

---

When you run "Process my backlog", the system will:
1. Detect "Fix login bug" might duplicate existing bug tasks
2. Ask for clarification on vague items like "that investor Tom"
3. Create subtasks for board meeting items
4. Auto-categorize (technical, outreach, writing, admin)
5. Suggest priorities based on urgency and your goals
