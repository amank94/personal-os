None

## Decision Filters

Before saying YES to anything, ask:
1. Does this align with my 12-month vision?
2. Is this the best use of my time vs other opportunities?
3. What would I need to say NO to in order to do this well?
4. Does this build skills, relationships, or credibility I need?

## Weekly Review Questions

Every week, reflect on:
- What moved me closer to my quarterly objectives?
- What held me back or distracted me?
- What needs to change next week?
- Am I focusing on the right priorities?
- Which relationships need attention?

## Monthly Review Questions

Every month, assess:
- Are my quarterly objectives still the right ones?
- What's my velocity toward the 12-month vision?
- What skills gaps are becoming critical?
- Which relationships are bearing fruit?
- What opportunities should I pursue or drop?

## Notes & Reminders

- **Ambition**: Dream 10x, not 10% better
- **Speed**: It's just as hard to dream big as dream small
- **Focus**: Warren Buffett's rule - "The difference between successful people and really successful people is that really successful people say no to almost everything"
- **Momentum**: Small wins compound - ship weekly, not monthly
- **Network**: Your network is your net worth - invest in relationships
- **Learning**: Learn from the best people, not just from books
