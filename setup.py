## Weekly Review Questions
- What moved me closer to my vision this week?
- What held me back?
- What needs to change next week?

## Decision Filter
Before taking on new commitments, ask:
- Does this align with my 12-month vision?
- Is this in my zone of genius?
- What would I need to say no to?

## Notes
- Review monthly and adjust course
- Dreams without deadlines are just wishes
- Progress > Perfection
